# UMD Region Changer
##### Presented by ARK-4 Team

1. After compiling the files will be in `dist`

2. After copying `UMD_Region_Changer` to `ms0:/PSP/GAME` make sure your UMD door is **NOT** closed/detected then run it.

3. Menu shows which region you want to your UMD Drive to mimic. Please keep UMD out until XMB displays.

4. Select and enjoy!

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This is not persistant, if you take the UMD out and reinsert it will revert to default region.</p>
